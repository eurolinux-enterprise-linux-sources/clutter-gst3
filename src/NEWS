clutter-gst 2.99.0 (19/11/2013)
===============================================================================

List of changes

 o Split the concept of player from the concept of video display in
   the Clutter scenegraph (ie. you can now display the same or part of
   the same video stream several times in a one or multiple Clutter
   scenes)

   You should start by creating a Player that is in charge of decoding
   a video (ClutterGstPlayer interface).

   2 player classes are currently available :
     ClutterGstPlayback (wrapper around playbin)
     ClutterGstCamera (wrapper around camerabin)

   You then attach a player to one of the ClutterGstContent, and put
   the content into a ClutterActor anywhere in a scene.

 o Introduce ClutterGstPlayer interface as a replacement for
   ClutterMedia

 o Introduce ClutterGstCameraManager to discover/list available camera
   on the system

 o Remove usage of Clutter and Cogl deprecated APIs

 o Add many example to help with usage of the new API, including
   JavaScript examples (see examples/ directory).

 o Rework a basic GStreamer plugin
